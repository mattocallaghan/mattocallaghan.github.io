title: "Convergence of NUTS algorithm with Normalizing Flow target densities"
excerpt: "I have developed normalizing architectures and shown that under certain assumptions the No U-turn Sampler will converge to the 
target density if it constains a normalizing flow component in the Hamiltonian. In the GIF below I show the leap-frog integration for a Hamiltonian with normalizing flow component. <br/><img src='/images/bnaf_arctan_Leap.gif'>"
