# About Me

Hello! I'm Matthew, a final year PhD student at the University of Cambridge, working in the Institute of Astronomy. My research focuses on probabilistic machine learning methods and their applications in understanding the stars in our Galaxy and the dusty interstellar medium.

## Current Research

### Astronomy
I am using Gaia distances and photometric surveys to develop a probabilistic prior over stellar magnitudes and colors. This approach helps in inferring interstellar extinction, particularly at high Galactic latitude regions. Future work will build on these priors to generate small-scale dust maps in regions of the Galaxy where dust is diffuse. 

### Machine Learning
My work involves constructing normalizing flow architectures that ensure geometric ergodicity of the No U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) Kernel. This is essential for succesfully including a normalizing flow as a prior or likelihood function in a differentiable hierarchical model which uses the NUTS algorithm.

### Earth Atmospheric Physics 
I also work at the National Obvervatory of Athens where I am building a probabilistic model to understand the optical properties of irregular shaped particles in our atmosphere. This work will significantly speed up the calculation of complex properties of irregularly shaped particles.

## Past Research

### Astronomy
I have explored the information available at high Galactic latitudes for inferring extinction, contributing to a better understanding of the interstellar medium and its properties. [My first paper](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/535/3/2149/7831690) showed that degeneracies between extinction and other stellar parameters are particularly difficult to overcome in these regions and will have a particular impact on CMB experiments. We also showed that using models of stellar evolution for a zero-extinction sample of stars contains systematics which are very problematic for inferring low variation in extinction. Moreover, inferring extinction in these regions is prior dominated and accounting for the systematics in correctly matching priors introduces a systematic in the extinction calculations which is difficult to overcome. We are solving this problem by working entirely from a data-driven perspective.

### Symplectic Geometry
In 2020-2021 I completed the Part III masters in Mathematics at the University of Cambridge. I was awarded a distinction for my paper [Symplectic Reduciton and Poisson Geometry](http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/19515/1/Symplectic_Reduction_and_Poisson_Geometry_of_Three_Dimensional_Lie_Groups%20(14).pdf), which provided a background on the topic and proceeded to look at the coadjoint orbits of the Bianchi Lie group and derived the Hamiltonian dynamics for the corresponding cosmologies.
