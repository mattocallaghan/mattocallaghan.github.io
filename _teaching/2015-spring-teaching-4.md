Course description:

In this course we will introduce you to the basic concepts and best practices required to produce high quality, maintainable code for research. This will cover not only developing code for individual research but also developing code as part of a collaboration and for public release. The majority of the course will be in python, but the general principles taught are applicable to any programming task in any language.
