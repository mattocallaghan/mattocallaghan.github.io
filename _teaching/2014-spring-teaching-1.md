Supervised the introduction to machine learning course for the masters in Data Intensive Sciences at the Universty of Cambridge in 2023 and 2024.


Course description:

This course provides an introduction to basic methods of machine learning and their practical application. We discuss in depth the key components of machine learning, i.e. the data, the models, the optimisation targets (losses), and the optimisation algorithms. In contrast to the other core modules, the focus is on understanding the design principles in situations with large amounts of (complicated) data. We introduce neural network models and compare them with other approaches such as support vector machines for inference, and probability density estimators such as Gaussian Mixture Models.
