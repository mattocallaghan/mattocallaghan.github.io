Supervised the advanced machine learning course for the masters in Data Intensive Sciences at the Universty of Cambridge in 2024.


Course description:

This course will cover fundamental concepts and mathematical techniques for understanding how to apply statistical methods to machine learning and data intensive science. It will provide the necessary background for further courses in the program. The format will be lectures and example classes emphasising statistical analysis of scientific data, complementing the parallel course on Machine Learning which puts these ideas into practice. The course will predominantly cover frequentist statistics, with Bayesian methods covered in the Advanced Statistics course.
