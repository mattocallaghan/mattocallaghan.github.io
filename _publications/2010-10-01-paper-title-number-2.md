In the last hundred years, Classical Mechanics has been dwarfed by the development of Relativity and
Quantum Mechanics. However, significant mathematical developments have been made to Classical Mechanics in the same time frame and this essay aims to explore some of the recent advances. The purpose of this
essay is to understand Hamiltonian dynamics, Noetherâ€™s theorem and symmetry in a geometric framework
using Poisson geometry. In particular, we want to analyse the case when the natural configuration space of
a system is a Lie group G and transformations on the space correspond to the Lie group acting on itself.
